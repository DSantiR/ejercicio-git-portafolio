                        I often get asked where I get my inspiration from: in everyday's lil' details. And sometimes in 
                        leftover food I find in my beard.</p>

                    <h2 class="history">When I was 5, I got adbucted by a unicorn family. When they returned me to earth, 
                        I joined a designer school. But, fo’ real, what I learned with my kidnaptive family really gave 
                        an edge to my creative language.
